Today, I stand before you to speak about a concept that is both powerful and empowering — Democracy.

Democracy is not just a form of government; it is the voice of the people. It is the system where every individual, regardless of wealth, class, or background, has an equal say in how they are governed. It is the belief that power belongs to the people — and that governments should exist to serve, not to rule.

In a true democracy, decisions are not made behind closed doors, but out in the open. Rights are not granted by rulers, but guaranteed by law. It gives us the freedom to speak, to vote, to protest, and most importantly — to dream.

But democracy is not a one-time event; it is a daily responsibility. It is built by our participation, protected by our awareness, and strengthened by our unity. It demands that we stay informed, ask questions, and hold our leaders accountable.

As citizens, we must remember: silence is surrender, and apathy is dangerous. Democracy thrives when we care, when we act, and when we vote — not just in elections, but in everyday decisions that shape our communities.

Let us not take democracy for granted. Let us protect it, nurture it, and make it work for everyone, not just the few.

Because at the heart of democracy is a simple, powerful idea:
The people are the true rulers.

Thank you.
