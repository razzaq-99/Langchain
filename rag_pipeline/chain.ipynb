The University A rchivist is involved in the organisation \\nand care of both the archival records, and the current records management \\nprogramme and office, a position which provides an overview of the day to \\nday administrative needs placed on the records as well as the historical \\nexpectations held by administrators and researchers.\\nRecent literature1 on automation of current and non-current records \\nmanagement has made much of the fact that traditionally, archival finding \\naids have been provenance rather than subject-based. This has led to an \\nunderuse of archival material, as the user must know something about the \\ninstitution which created the records before he/she can access them. \\nGenerally it appears that more consideration is given to user education \\nthan user needs, when compiling guides.2 Automation is seen as a means of \\novercoming this problem, but the archivist is warned that there is still a \\nneed for clarity of approach and logic of procedure. It is currently felt that \\nemphasis is being given to automation more in the administrative control \\nof archives (eg. details relating to location of material) than the intellectual \\ncontrol, although Roper3 in the early 1970’s listed several institutions \\nwhich combined administrative and intellectual control in their current \\nrecords management programme. As well as performing these tasks \\npreviously effected manually, the computerised system can produce subject \\nspecified finding aids from the original data base. In addition, it can print \\nout various descriptions in various orders, and can allow a user to search \\nfor documents on a speeified subject.4\\nThis study relates to one record group in the custody of the Archives —  \\nthat of the Registrar’s Office. However, there is no reason why the \\nautomated current records management system could not be applied to all \\nadministrative Faculties/Departments within the University, although in \\norder to link archival material with the central archives, it would be \\nnecessary to have an interactive computer system between central \\nadministration and the Faculty/Department.'),\n",

A 570 page listing of \\nthese records was produced, arranged according to provenance, but it was \\ndecided that, in addition, a subject index was necessary as the original \\nclassification system of the file series was unintelligible. A computer \\nprogram was written to produce a keyword index to the series which \\nnumbered about 3000 files and dated from c 1913 to cl960. Keyword, file \\ntitle, and the first and last dates of each file were indexed. As the file titles \\nwere often uninformative, the subject content of each file was reviewed and \\nindexed by selected major keywords which best described the content of the \\nfile. The data was then punched on cards and an alpha index by keyword \\nproduced. Though this approach was necessarily subjective it formed a \\nuseful pilot project for the current records management system which was \\nlater instituted.\\nIn 1982 a review of the current records management system in the \\nCentral Administration was carried out by the University Archivist. This \\nsystem includes the Registrar’s Office, the Vice-Chancellory, (including the \\nStaffing Office) the Property Services Office, and the Bursar’s Office (now \\nAccounting Services). Cook’s5 description of the archivist being ‘the \\nessential finding guide to the material’could be applied equally validly to \\nthe Records Manager in this case. The filing system had been in operation \\nfor twenty years and the then records manager had been in charge of the \\noffice for half that period. The classification system was simply an add-on \\nrunning number system, combined with a broad subject indexing system. \\nThe series contained many ‘catch all’ files and files with imprecise titles so \\nthat some correspondence could be copied onto as many as six files, due to \\nthe indecision as to where it should be classified. Local knowledge was \\ntherefore an important factor in retrieving the information.\\nA Records Review Working Party was set up in July 1982 to consider the \\nfindings of the Review, and to formulate and report to the Registrar on \\nways of improving the system. The Working Party constituted the \\nUniversity Archivist, the Records Officer, and representatives of the main \\nsections or divisions using the system, such as the Academic Secretariat, \\nthe Staffing Office, etc. The Working Party’s major recommendations \\nincluded the institution of a meaningful number classification system and a \\nkeyword indexing system to replace the old system.\\nThe Working Party’s recommendations were adopted, and several \\noperational systems throughout Australia were examined and it was \\ndecided to implement a computerised KWOC (keyword out of Context) \\nindexing system combined with an hierarchical meaningful number \\nclassification system. Of the several computer software packages examined \\nthe Datatrieve package, on the then new Administration computer, a VAX \\n11/70, seemed the most appropriate.\\nThe project was allocated its own budget, and the development of the'),\n",

During this period the University Archivist \\nwas responsible for the compilation of the Classification Manual \\n(Appendix B) and the accompanying Thesaurus. (Appendix B.) This was \\nbased on a model developed by the University of Sydney which was \\ninstituted only two years previously.\\nIt is at this stage of the development of any such system that there should \\nbe the greatest interaction with general administrative staff particularly the \\nexpert in each area. As others have discovered,6 the introduction of office \\nautomation is likely to be a traumatic experience for both management and \\nstaff; resentment is easily aroused if there is not sufficient consultation with \\nmiddle management regarding the structuring of a system.

This meant that from the users’ \\nview point the prime requirements were the facility to access any file by \\nboth subject and location. The main Records Office requirements were \\nobvious —  the staff needed to find the right file in as little time as possible; \\nrefinements and enhancements were developed as planning and \\nimplementation proceeded.\\nFeatures of the System\\nData Storage\\nThe system comprises thirteen domains (or files) of which five are back \\nup domains. The main data collections are;\\nMaster domain\\nClosed domain\\nArchive domain\\nHistory domain (list of all files destroyed)\\nKeyword domain (List of keywords in use)\\nTracking domain (records all files on loan)\\n‘Bring-forwards’ requests file\\nDomain of files borrowed in any given day\\n‘Unfiled’ or ‘Dead’ filing domain\\nAny of these Domains can be edited via a VDU, but there are three levels \\nof security imposed, so that only the Records Officer and Supervisor can \\namend the Master Domain, for instance, whilst a morejunior staff member \\ncan alter the Tracking Domain.'),\n",

(Figure 2)\\nAs a result of the integration of these systems the ‘unfiled’filing, which \\nhitherto has accummulated to unmanageable proportion, especially during \\nthe busy enrolment period, is now maintained at more controllable levels.\\nArchival Features\\nFrom the archivist’s point of view it was important to structure the \\nclassification system with archival requirements in mind. Policy \\ndocuments were separated from housekeeping documents from the outset, \\nthus eliminating the need for much stripping at a later date. In order to \\nconserve computer time, a ‘Closed’ Domain was established, into which \\ndetails of back volumes of any file are transferred automatically when a \\nnew file is opened. Thus the master file contains only the details of the \\ncurrent volume of any file and less time is spent answering queries \\nregarding current files. The ‘Closed’ Domain is a record of semi-current \\nmaterial which is to be either retained permanently or culled after a \\nspecified period. When files which are to be retained permanently are \\nculled from the ‘Closed’ Domain they are transferred to the ‘Archive’ \\nDomain; details of files which are destroyed after culling are transferred to \\nthe ‘History’ Domain.'),\n",

Based on these periods, a ‘Cull’or‘Review’list can be compiled from \\nthe ‘Closed’ Domain at any time, using the ‘close’date, or from the‘Master’ \\nDomain using the file ‘opening’ date and adding the retention period plus \\ntwo years. This ensures that files which have been opened and used only for \\na short period are culled from the Master file regularly.\\nClassification S\\\\\\\\stent\\nOne of the main differences between this and other indexing systems \\ncurrently being advocated in Australia is the fact that it is based on a \\nstructured classification system. Information has been divided into ten \\ncategories (or primary headings) with the capacity to develop an unlimited \\nnumber of keywords and descriptors defining more explicitly concepts \\nwithin those categories. A Classification Manual For General Files has \\nbeen compiled for use by Records Office staff. (See Appendix A). In \\naddition, aThesaurus of preferred terms enables the classifier to access the \\nClassification Manual at the required subject. (See Appendix B)\\nAlthough other classification models were examined, it was decided to \\nimplement a meaningful number classification system to three levels; that \\nis, category, keyword, and first descriptors are encoded according to the \\nhierarchical classification system. (See Appendix C for example.) This \\nreplaced the old add-on four digit numbering system. As the old files had \\nbeen ‘catch-all’ files very few could simply be top-numbered into the new \\nsystem; in most cases more than one file was opened to replace an old \\nsystem file. An important advantage of a meaningful classification system \\nis that as like material is held together, facilitating both retrieval by \\nRecords Office staff (when a subset of material is required, it is easier to \\npull from the same area than throughout the system) and reference and \\nresearch by Administrative staff.\\nIn some cases many files replaced old files. For example, in the case of \\nResearch Grant files, previously one file was opened for each University \\ndepartment within each granting body; in the new series each project has \\nbeen allocated a file so that the full history of any grant can be collated at a \\nglance. This feature is particularly valuable in the case of the larger \\ngranting bodies, for example, National Health and Medical Research \\nCouncil (NH&MRC) or Australian Research Grants Scheme (ARGS), \\nwho allocate a number of grants to specified University departments.\\nThe files are colour-coded at category level only, but it is proposed to \\nintroduce full colour-coding (perhaps tied to bar-coding) of general files at \\na later date.\\nKWOC Index\\nAn up-to-date on line KWOC (Keyword Out of Context) index is'),\n",

The level of \\nsophistication of automated finding aids is by necessity inhibited by the \\ncost factor, and given the size and requirements of the institution, the \\nUniversity of Western Australia’s system seems best for an institution the \\nsize of this University. Indeed in 1985, Murdoch University seconded the \\nArchivist from the University of Western Australia, and as a consequence \\nof a report on their current records system, that University has decided to \\nadopt the same system for its own use. The system seems to be as efficient \\nas, and has very similar features to, other more costly systems which have \\nbeen developed within government departments, for instance the Records \\nManagement System (RMS) in the Western Australian Public Service \\nBoard, which is not based on an hierarchical classification system.'),\n",

For \\ninstance, although it was originally planned to include a procedure to \\nmaintain statistical details such as title of officer and date of recent use of \\neach file, this proved too expensive in computer time because of the need \\nfor the programme to interact with the master file.\\nConsequently, although this feature is recognised by experts in the field \\nas one of the great benefits of automation8 it has been abandoned in this \\ninstance. However, it is still possible to identify recent users, as officers’ \\ntitles are listed on the face sheet as a directive when the file is checked out. \\nIn addition, a hard copy of the list of borrowers is produced daily, and this \\ncould be checked if a file is lost. The benefits of the automated historical \\nrecord therefore only become apparent if the file is lost.\\nOn the advice of the computer programmer designing the system a \\ndecision was made not to display the procedures in menu form but simply \\nto name each procedure and to educate users to identify these accordingly. \\nOther records management systems examined do use a menu format, as do \\nother computerised systems within the University, so it may have been \\neasier to the uninitiated to have menu prompting. However, for regular \\nusers of the system, ie Records Office Staff, it is in fact quicker to use \\nprocedures, which was the initial rationale for adopting this format.\\nAnother refinement which is currently under consideration is the \\ninstitution of a bar-code checking system. The main problems with \\nadopting bar codes are expense, the lack of reliability in available systems, \\nthe problem of durability and the fact that bar codes relate to the equivalent \\nof an accession number, rather than the hierarchical classification file \\nnumber. However, finances permitting, it is a feature worth considering \\nwhen setting up a new records management system.\\nThese reservations aside, the system has greatly improved the efficiency \\nof the Records Office and eliminated much error.

In 1981/82 a survey of 979 North \\nAmerican tertiary institutions was undertaken covering three main \\nsubjects: responsibility for machine readable records and computerised \\nstorage media; the use of automation in the intellectual and physical \\ncontrol of holdings by means of internal automated control systems and \\nthe use of word-processing and other systems for the preparation of finding \\naids; and the sharing of holdings information in library or archival data \\nbases and the consideration of archives in the planning of library \\nautomation on campus.9 More recently Michael Cook conducted a survey \\nof automated services in Britain outside the Government Public Record \\nOffice. It would be of immense benefit to institutions within Australia \\ncontemplating the introduction of an automated records management \\nsystem, either current or archival, to be able to identify other operative \\nsystems and to obtain details of the software. Cook made two \\nrecommendations in his report: that a data standard for archival \\ndescription be developed; and that a comparative study of the suitability of \\nsoftware packages be undertaken.\\nThe first recommendation is currently being researched by Michael \\nCook, and the International Council on Archives Automation Committee \\nhas commenced a review of the latter question.10\\nProfessional records managers and archivists in Australia would benefit \\nconsiderably if our associations undertook a similar survey in this country \\nwith a view to producing at least a listing of available software packages; \\nCook’s data standard should also be considered for adoption when \\npublished.\\nIn considering this proposal it is worth recalling Lytle’s comments at the \\nSymposium ‘Archival Automation: Future access to the past’:\\nMost assuredly agreement seems to crystalize around one basic observation: \\nthe central problem in modernizing archives is not really automat\\\\onper se; it \\nis a substantive archival problem in defining purpose and methodology.\\nIt seems evident, therefore, that before effective automation can be \\naccomplished, archivists should re-evaluate their traditional notions about \\nthe peculiarities of records from different institutions.

Too much thinkingand \\nprofessional activities are channeled into these specialised groups, as recently \\nenshrined in the SAA PAG (Professional Affinity Group) structure, thus \\nimpeding common progress in resolving the large, overall problems faced by \\nall archives.\\nA similar assumption in the profession is that archives and manuscript \\ncollections are different enough to require separate retrieval solutions. This \\nassumption has been questioned for years, most notably by the reflective \\nthinker Theodore Schellenberg, but this idea remains today and surfaces in \\nunexpected ways from time to time. It is nevertheless merely an assumption, \\nthe counterpart to the distinction between active and inactive records. There \\nare noteworthy differences, to be sure, but these may not influence retrieval \\nconsiderations as much as other areas of archival concern.11\\nIt is hoped that archivists will heed Lytle’s words and that endeavours to \\nproduce data standards which can be used internationally will soon be \\nsuccessful.\\nAcknowledgements\\nMr Noel Rogers, Records Manager, University of Sydney, for providing \\ndocumentation and discussing the principles of keyword indexing as \\napplied to University records.\\nMrs Carole Herriman of Western Australian Regional Computing \\nCentre for surveying needs and drawing up computer specifications and \\nMrs Pene Duffy of Western Australian Regional Computer Centre for \\nundertaking the programming.'),\n",

A 570 page listing of \\nthese records was produced, arranged according to provenance, but it was \\ndecided that, in addition, a subject index was necessary as the original \\nclassification system of the file series was unintelligible. A computer \\nprogram was written to produce a keyword index to the series which \\nnumbered about 3000 files and dated from c 1913 to cl960. Keyword, file \\ntitle, and the first and last dates of each file were indexed. As the file titles \\nwere often uninformative, the subject content of each file was reviewed and \\nindexed by selected major keywords which best described the content of the \\nfile.
