It is the system where every individual, regardless of wealth, class, or background, has an equal say in how they are governed. It is the belief that power belongs to the people â€” and that governments should exist to serve, not to rule.\\n\\nIn a true democracy, decisions are not made behind closed doors, but out in the open. Rights are not granted by rulers, but guaranteed by law. It gives us the freedom to speak, to vote, to protest, and most importantly â€” to dream.\\n\\nBut democracy is not a one-time event; it is a daily responsibility. It is built by our participation, protected by our awareness, and strengthened by our unity. It demands that we stay informed, ask questions, and hold our leaders accountable.\\n\\nAs citizens, we must remember: silence is surrender, and apathy is dangerous. Democracy thrives when we care, when we act, and when we vote â€” not just in elections, but in everyday decisions that shape our communities.\\n\\nLet us not take democracy for granted. Let us protect it, nurture it, and make it work for everyone, not just the few.\\n\\nBecause at the heart of democracy is a simple, powerful idea:\\nThe people are the true rulers.\\n\\nThank you.')]"

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\n\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\n\\nExperiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\n\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\n\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\n\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

The University A rchivist is involved in the organisation \\nand care of both the archival records, and the current records management \\nprogramme and office, a position which provides an overview of the day to \\nday administrative needs placed on the records as well as the historical \\nexpectations held by administrators and researchers.\\nRecent literature1 on automation of current and non-current records \\nmanagement has made much of the fact that traditionally, archival finding \\naids have been provenance rather than subject-based. This has led to an \\nunderuse of archival material, as the user must know something about the \\ninstitution which created the records before he/she can access them. \\nGenerally it appears that more consideration is given to user education \\nthan user needs, when compiling guides.2 Automation is seen as a means of \\novercoming this problem, but the archivist is warned that there is still a \\nneed for clarity of approach and logic of procedure. It is currently felt that \\nemphasis is being given to automation more in the administrative control \\nof archives (eg. details relating to location of material) than the intellectual \\ncontrol, although Roper3 in the early 1970’s listed several institutions \\nwhich combined administrative and intellectual control in their current \\nrecords management programme. As well as performing these tasks \\npreviously effected manually, the computerised system can produce subject \\nspecified finding aids from the original data base. In addition, it can print \\nout various descriptions in various orders, and can allow a user to search \\nfor documents on a speeified subject.4\\nThis study relates to one record group in the custody of the Archives —  \\nthat of the Registrar’s Office. However, there is no reason why the \\nautomated current records management system could not be applied to all \\nadministrative Faculties/Departments within the University, although in \\norder to link archival material with the central archives, it would be \\nnecessary to have an interactive computer system between central \\nadministration and the Faculty/Department.'),\n",

A 570 page listing of \\nthese records was produced, arranged according to provenance, but it was \\ndecided that, in addition, a subject index was necessary as the original \\nclassification system of the file series was unintelligible. A computer \\nprogram was written to produce a keyword index to the series which \\nnumbered about 3000 files and dated from c 1913 to cl960. Keyword, file \\ntitle, and the first and last dates of each file were indexed. As the file titles \\nwere often uninformative, the subject content of each file was reviewed and \\nindexed by selected major keywords which best described the content of the \\nfile. The data was then punched on cards and an alpha index by keyword \\nproduced. Though this approach was necessarily subjective it formed a \\nuseful pilot project for the current records management system which was \\nlater instituted.\\nIn 1982 a review of the current records management system in the \\nCentral Administration was carried out by the University Archivist. This \\nsystem includes the Registrar’s Office, the Vice-Chancellory, (including the \\nStaffing Office) the Property Services Office, and the Bursar’s Office (now \\nAccounting Services). Cook’s5 description of the archivist being ‘the \\nessential finding guide to the material’could be applied equally validly to \\nthe Records Manager in this case. The filing system had been in operation \\nfor twenty years and the then records manager had been in charge of the \\noffice for half that period. The classification system was simply an add-on \\nrunning number system, combined with a broad subject indexing system. \\nThe series contained many ‘catch all’ files and files with imprecise titles so \\nthat some correspondence could be copied onto as many as six files, due to \\nthe indecision as to where it should be classified. Local knowledge was \\ntherefore an important factor in retrieving the information.\\nA Records Review Working Party was set up in July 1982 to consider the \\nfindings of the Review, and to formulate and report to the Registrar on \\nways of improving the system. The Working Party constituted the \\nUniversity Archivist, the Records Officer, and representatives of the main \\nsections or divisions using the system, such as the Academic Secretariat, \\nthe Staffing Office, etc. The Working Party’s major recommendations \\nincluded the institution of a meaningful number classification system and a \\nkeyword indexing system to replace the old system.\\nThe Working Party’s recommendations were adopted, and several \\noperational systems throughout Australia were examined and it was \\ndecided to implement a computerised KWOC (keyword out of Context) \\nindexing system combined with an hierarchical meaningful number \\nclassification system. Of the several computer software packages examined \\nthe Datatrieve package, on the then new Administration computer, a VAX \\n11/70, seemed the most appropriate.\\nThe project was allocated its own budget, and the development of the'),\n",

During this period the University Archivist \\nwas responsible for the compilation of the Classification Manual \\n(Appendix B) and the accompanying Thesaurus. (Appendix B.) This was \\nbased on a model developed by the University of Sydney which was \\ninstituted only two years previously.\\nIt is at this stage of the development of any such system that there should \\nbe the greatest interaction with general administrative staff particularly the \\nexpert in each area. As others have discovered,6 the introduction of office \\nautomation is likely to be a traumatic experience for both management and \\nstaff; resentment is easily aroused if there is not sufficient consultation with \\nmiddle management regarding the structuring of a system. Input from \\npractitioners is necessary when planning the intellectual control needed for \\nsuch a system if it is to be successful in operation.\\nThe basic requirements then were to devise a system to serve both the \\nadministrative staff and the Records Office. This meant that from the users’ \\nview point the prime requirements were the facility to access any file by \\nboth subject and location. The main Records Office requirements were \\nobvious —  the staff needed to find the right file in as little time as possible; \\nrefinements and enhancements were developed as planning and \\nimplementation proceeded.\\nFeatures of the System\\nData Storage\\nThe system comprises thirteen domains (or files) of which five are back \\nup domains. The main data collections are;\\nMaster domain\\nClosed domain\\nArchive domain\\nHistory domain (list of all files destroyed)\\nKeyword domain (List of keywords in use)\\nTracking domain (records all files on loan)\\n‘Bring-forwards’ requests file\\nDomain of files borrowed in any given day\\n‘Unfiled’ or ‘Dead’ filing domain\\nAny of these Domains can be edited via a VDU, but there are three levels \\nof security imposed, so that only the Records Officer and Supervisor can \\namend the Master Domain, for instance, whilst a morejunior staff member \\ncan alter the Tracking Domain.'),\n",

When a file is returned it is flagged if either a‘bring forward’ \\nhas been placed on the file or if there are some non-current ‘unfiled’ \\ndocuments to be filed. A hard copy numerical listing of all files borrowed \\nis produced daily. (Figure 2)\\nAs a result of the integration of these systems the ‘unfiled’filing, which \\nhitherto has accummulated to unmanageable proportion, especially during \\nthe busy enrolment period, is now maintained at more controllable levels.\\nArchival Features\\nFrom the archivist’s point of view it was important to structure the \\nclassification system with archival requirements in mind. Policy \\ndocuments were separated from housekeeping documents from the outset, \\nthus eliminating the need for much stripping at a later date. In order to \\nconserve computer time, a ‘Closed’ Domain was established, into which \\ndetails of back volumes of any file are transferred automatically when a \\nnew file is opened. Thus the master file contains only the details of the \\ncurrent volume of any file and less time is spent answering queries \\nregarding current files. The ‘Closed’ Domain is a record of semi-current \\nmaterial which is to be either retained permanently or culled after a \\nspecified period.

Based on these periods, a ‘Cull’or‘Review’list can be compiled from \\nthe ‘Closed’ Domain at any time, using the ‘close’date, or from the‘Master’ \\nDomain using the file ‘opening’ date and adding the retention period plus \\ntwo years. This ensures that files which have been opened and used only for \\na short period are culled from the Master file regularly.\\nClassification S\\\\\\\\stent\\nOne of the main differences between this and other indexing systems \\ncurrently being advocated in Australia is the fact that it is based on a \\nstructured classification system. Information has been divided into ten \\ncategories (or primary headings) with the capacity to develop an unlimited \\nnumber of keywords and descriptors defining more explicitly concepts \\nwithin those categories. A Classification Manual For General Files has \\nbeen compiled for use by Records Office staff. (See Appendix A). In \\naddition, aThesaurus of preferred terms enables the classifier to access the \\nClassification Manual at the required subject. (See Appendix B)\\nAlthough other classification models were examined, it was decided to \\nimplement a meaningful number classification system to three levels; that \\nis, category, keyword, and first descriptors are encoded according to the \\nhierarchical classification system. (See Appendix C for example.) This \\nreplaced the old add-on four digit numbering system. As the old files had \\nbeen ‘catch-all’ files very few could simply be top-numbered into the new \\nsystem; in most cases more than one file was opened to replace an old \\nsystem file. An important advantage of a meaningful classification system \\nis that as like material is held together, facilitating both retrieval by \\nRecords Office staff (when a subset of material is required, it is easier to \\npull from the same area than throughout the system) and reference and \\nresearch by Administrative staff.\\nIn some cases many files replaced old files. For example, in the case of \\nResearch Grant files, previously one file was opened for each University \\ndepartment within each granting body; in the new series each project has \\nbeen allocated a file so that the full history of any grant can be collated at a \\nglance. This feature is particularly valuable in the case of the larger \\ngranting bodies, for example, National Health and Medical Research \\nCouncil (NH&MRC) or Australian Research Grants Scheme (ARGS), \\nwho allocate a number of grants to specified University departments.\\nThe files are colour-coded at category level only, but it is proposed to \\nintroduce full colour-coding (perhaps tied to bar-coding) of general files at \\na later date.\\nKWOC Index\\nAn up-to-date on line KWOC (Keyword Out of Context) index is'),\n",

The level of \\nsophistication of automated finding aids is by necessity inhibited by the \\ncost factor, and given the size and requirements of the institution, the \\nUniversity of Western Australia’s system seems best for an institution the \\nsize of this University. Indeed in 1985, Murdoch University seconded the \\nArchivist from the University of Western Australia, and as a consequence \\nof a report on their current records system, that University has decided to \\nadopt the same system for its own use. The system seems to be as efficient \\nas, and has very similar features to, other more costly systems which have \\nbeen developed within government departments, for instance the Records \\nManagement System (RMS) in the Western Australian Public Service \\nBoard, which is not based on an hierarchical classification system.'),\n",

For \\ninstance, although it was originally planned to include a procedure to \\nmaintain statistical details such as title of officer and date of recent use of \\neach file, this proved too expensive in computer time because of the need \\nfor the programme to interact with the master file.\\nConsequently, although this feature is recognised by experts in the field \\nas one of the great benefits of automation8 it has been abandoned in this \\ninstance. However, it is still possible to identify recent users, as officers’ \\ntitles are listed on the face sheet as a directive when the file is checked out. \\nIn addition, a hard copy of the list of borrowers is produced daily, and this \\ncould be checked if a file is lost. The benefits of the automated historical \\nrecord therefore only become apparent if the file is lost.\\nOn the advice of the computer programmer designing the system a \\ndecision was made not to display the procedures in menu form but simply \\nto name each procedure and to educate users to identify these accordingly. \\nOther records management systems examined do use a menu format, as do \\nother computerised systems within the University, so it may have been \\neasier to the uninitiated to have menu prompting. However, for regular \\nusers of the system, ie Records Office Staff, it is in fact quicker to use \\nprocedures, which was the initial rationale for adopting this format.\\nAnother refinement which is currently under consideration is the \\ninstitution of a bar-code checking system. The main problems with \\nadopting bar codes are expense, the lack of reliability in available systems, \\nthe problem of durability and the fact that bar codes relate to the equivalent \\nof an accession number, rather than the hierarchical classification file \\nnumber. However, finances permitting, it is a feature worth considering \\nwhen setting up a new records management system.\\nThese reservations aside, the system has greatly improved the efficiency \\nof the Records Office and eliminated much error.

In 1981/82 a survey of 979 North \\nAmerican tertiary institutions was undertaken covering three main \\nsubjects: responsibility for machine readable records and computerised \\nstorage media; the use of automation in the intellectual and physical \\ncontrol of holdings by means of internal automated control systems and \\nthe use of word-processing and other systems for the preparation of finding \\naids; and the sharing of holdings information in library or archival data \\nbases and the consideration of archives in the planning of library \\nautomation on campus.9 More recently Michael Cook conducted a survey \\nof automated services in Britain outside the Government Public Record \\nOffice. It would be of immense benefit to institutions within Australia \\ncontemplating the introduction of an automated records management \\nsystem, either current or archival, to be able to identify other operative \\nsystems and to obtain details of the software. Cook made two \\nrecommendations in his report: that a data standard for archival \\ndescription be developed; and that a comparative study of the suitability of \\nsoftware packages be undertaken.\\nThe first recommendation is currently being researched by Michael \\nCook, and the International Council on Archives Automation Committee \\nhas commenced a review of the latter question.10\\nProfessional records managers and archivists in Australia would benefit \\nconsiderably if our associations undertook a similar survey in this country \\nwith a view to producing at least a listing of available software packages; \\nCook’s data standard should also be considered for adoption when \\npublished.\\nIn considering this proposal it is worth recalling Lytle’s comments at the \\nSymposium ‘Archival Automation: Future access to the past’:\\nMost assuredly agreement seems to crystalize around one basic observation: \\nthe central problem in modernizing archives is not really automat\\\\onper se; it \\nis a substantive archival problem in defining purpose and methodology.\\nIt seems evident, therefore, that before effective automation can be \\naccomplished, archivists should re-evaluate their traditional notions about \\nthe peculiarities of records from different institutions.
